/** Upgradeable proxy pattern for Cardano smart contracts.
  *
  * The pattern works by having a spend validator ensure that a stake validator has been called by
  * checking that
  *   - a withdrawal has been made;
  *   - the withdrawal has been made from a known trusted script address.
  *
  * A combination of these conditions ensure that the validator has been called, thus allowing a
  * forced script composition.
  *
  * This also ensures that the logic can be changed (upgraded), by updating the known trusted script
  * address, that is stored in the datum. In this illustration, a proxy has an owner, which can
  * update the datum. In a real application, a more sophisticated approach should be preferred, to
  * ensure trustlessness.
